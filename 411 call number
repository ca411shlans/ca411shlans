Here's how I tend to think about it: Is what you see what you get? A payday loan today is packaged as a two-week loan with a fixed fee of about $55 on average. But the typical borrower is in debt for almost half a year and pays more than $500 in fees before getting out from under a payday loan debt.

In general, that's how the payday loan business model works. It's not profitable unless the average borrower renews or reborrows over the course of several months. It's true that a small percentage of borrowers (less than 15 percent or so) use only one or two and then walk away, but they represent only 2 or 3 percent of a lender's revenue. The vast majority of revenue comes from typical borrowers who have to roll over or renew the loans repeatedly because they cannot afford to lose one-third or more of their paycheck and still make ends meet without borrowing again.
