411 cash loan

https://www.411cashloan.com/

411 cash loan, the states with the most payday loan companies have the highest prices, even though competition normally lowers prices. It turns out that payday loans are mostly expensive because the lenders are inefficient: The average store serves only 500 unique customers each year and spends two-thirds of its revenue on overhead.

If the 411 cash loan sets clear standards, banks and credit unions are ready to step up and offer loans at prices six times lower. So borrowing $400 for three months from a payday lender on average costs about $360, but banks and credit unions can make that loan profitably for $50 to $60.
